# sql-limiter

Injects and enforces `LIMIT`, `FIRST`, and/or `FETCH` in your SQL statements.

[Try it](https://sqlpad.github.io/sql-limiter/)

```js
const sqlLimiter = require("sql-limiter");

const enforcedSql = sqlLimiter.limit(
  `SELECT * FROM some_table limit 999;`,
  ["limit", "fetch"], // limit strategies to detect/enforce
  100 // max allowed limit
);
console.log(enforcedSql); // SELECT * FROM some_table limit 100;
```

It is database agnostic, aiming to support anything that kinda looks like SQL (ANSI or not).

It ignores non-SELECT queries. It understands CTE statements. It understands strings and comments. If you are limiting multiple statements it assumes your SQL statements are terminated by either `;` or `\g`;

## API

### `sqlLimiter.limit( sqlText, limitStrategies, limitNumber, offsetNumber )`

- `sqlText` - SQL text to enforce limits on. Multiple statements allowed. Only `SELECT` statements are targeted.
- `limitStrategies` - Keyword or array of strategies used to restrict rows. Must be either `limit`, `first`, `top`, `fetch` for `FETCH NEXT`/`FETCH FIRST`.
- `limitNumber` - Number of rows to allow. If number in statement is lower, it is untouched. If higher it is lowered to limit. If missing it is added.
- `offsetNumber` - Number of rows to skip before beginning to return rows from the query. If number in statement is defined, it is untouched. If missing it is added.

Returns `sqlText` with limits enforced.

When an existing limit is not found in a `SELECT` query, `limitStrategies` is used to define priority of strategy used. This is useful for databases that support both, such as Postgres.

#### Example:

```js
// When limit is first
const enforcedSql = sqlLimiter.limit(
  `SELECT * FROM some_table;`,
  ["limit", "fetch"],
  100
);
console.log(enforcedSql); // SELECT * FROM some_table limit 100;

// When fetch is first
const enforcedSql = sqlLimiter.limit(
  `SELECT * FROM some_table;`,
  ["fetch", "limit"],
  100
);
console.log(enforcedSql); // SELECT * FROM some_table fetch first 100 rows only;

// When offset is defined
const enforcedSql = sqlLimiter.limit(
  `SELECT * FROM some_table;`,
  "limit",
  100,
  10
);
console.log(enforcedSql); // SELECT * FROM some_table limit 100 offset 10;
```

### `sqlLimiter.getStatements( sqlText )`

- `sqlText` - SQL text to parse and split into individual statements.

Returns array of statement strings. Used by `sql-limiter` internally but exposed for your convenience.

### `sqlLimiter.removeTerminator( sqlStatement )`

- `sqlStatement` - Single SQL statement text to remove terminator from.

Returns `sqlStatement` string with terminator removed. Used by `sql-limiter` internally but exposed for your convenience

### `sqlLimiter.getStatementType( sqlStatement )`

- `sqlStatement` - Single SQL statement text to get type keyword from.

Returns `sqlStatement` type keyword in lower case. This will be the first keyword of the SQL query, sans `with` and `as` for CTE queries.

```js
console.log(sqlLimiter.getStatementType("SELECT * FROM ...")); // "select"
console.log(
  sqlLimiter.getStatementType("WITH foo AS (SELECT ...) INSERT INTO ... ")
); // "insert"
console.log(sqlLimiter.getStatementType("-- just a comment")); // undefined
```

## Why

`sql-limiter` was initially created to enforce SQL limits in [SQLPad](https://github.com/sqlpad/sqlpad).

In SQLPad, users run arbitrary SQL against a database, and the application needs to be protected from `SELECT * FROM really_big_table` queries.

Some database drivers support the ability to stream SQL results, and then terminate the query midstream. Most drivers/databases don't support this however, and for those that do it can be kind of tricky. It also isn't as efficient as telling the database the results are to be limited, as that may impact the query execution plan depending on the database.

## How

The SQL statement is tokenized using the excellent [moo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moo) package.

The resulting tokens are traversed to attempt to detect and enforce the limit.

This library is _not_ a full fledged SQL parser. You may run into some edge cases depending on your target database. If you run into anything, please open an issue.

## FETCH FIRST/NEXT n ROWS ONLY

`FETCH FIRST` was added into the SQL standard in SQL:2008. Markus Winand has [a great guide written about this](https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/partial-results/top-n-queries).

`sql-limiter` will look for `FETCH FIRST <number>` and `FETCH NEXT <number>` to detect the use of `FETCH` use. If neither are found, `FETCH FIRST <number> ROWS ONLY` will be added to the query.

The `fetch` strategy assumes that the target database honors the `FETCH FIRST` syntax alone, not requiring preceding `ORDER BY` or `OFFSET` clauses.

## SQL Server Users Beware

While `sql-limiter` has a `top` strategy and `fetch` strategy, **it most likely will not meet your needs if you are trying to limit SQL intended for SQL Server**.

SQL Server's TOP is great for single SELECT queries, but becomes problematic for queries unioned together. `TOP` only applies to the `SELECT` clause it is used in, as opposed to acting on the entire unioned result set. For example:

```sql
-- For SQL Server, this query would return 1,000,005 rows
SELECT TOP 5 * FROM million_row_table
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM million_row_table

-- In Postgres, this query returns 5 rows
SELECT * FROM million_row_table
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM million_row_table
LIMIT 5
```

To achieve the same effect as `LIMIT` using `TOP` in SQL Server, you must wrap the query, and put the `TOP` in the wrapping query instead. This can be difficult without a proper SQL parser.

Instead of `TOP`, you could use `FETCH FIRST` in SQL Server 2012 and later, but is very strict! It requires preceding ORDER BY and OFFSET clauses to function, which also prove to be difficult to support and detect without a proper SQL parser (especially since variables and other things are supported in these clauses).
